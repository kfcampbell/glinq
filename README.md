# glinq

glinq (prounced "glink") is an attempt to re-implement some of github.com/samber/lo for my personal knowledge. The name uncreatively comes from combining Go and LINQ.

Long-term TODOs:
- Implement parallel operations
- Use fuzzing in testing
- Full coverage of functions in samber/lo
- Complete testing with code coverage
