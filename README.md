# glinq

glinq (prounced "glink") is an attempt to provide a LINQ API using Go generics. The name uncreatively comes from combining Go and LINQ. Inspired by github.com/samber/lo

Long-term TODOs:
- Implement parallel operations
- Use fuzzing in testing
- Full coverage of functions in LINQ
- Complete testing with code coverage
- Usage instructions and examples
- Cancellation (esp. in channel operations)
- Decide whether to implement container types (e.g. Set) like .NET has
- Use `t.Run(tc.name, ...)` as the testing pattern rather than the janky string constructions currently in place.
- Consider using literal instantiations instead of `make` everywhere

Is there a way to add these methods onto generic slices/chans? Probably not, but if possible, should we?
